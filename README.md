## About

## Requirements

## Installation

Clone this repository and upload the contents of the calendar-v2 folder to your web root.

Open the includes/config.php file with a text editor of your choice.

<img src="../media/config_php_top_screenshot.png?raw=true" width="500" />

Search for `define("DBHOST", "localhost");` and edit this line and three lines
that follow to complete the database details setup. Make sure that these details
are correct and the database has already been created in MySQL before proceeding.

Now scroll down to the bottom of the page and uncomment the lines that are
commented out.

Open a web browser and visit the url you uploaded the project to complete the
database setup. Return back to your code edit and comment out the code you
previously uncommented out and you are ready to go.
